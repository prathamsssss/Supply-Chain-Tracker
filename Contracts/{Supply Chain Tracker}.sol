# Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Description

The Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based solution built on Ethereum that provides transparent, immutable, and efficient tracking of products throughout their entire supply chain journey. This smart contract system enables manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to track products from manufacturing to final sale, ensuring authenticity, reducing fraud, and improving supply chain visibility.

The system leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where all stakeholders can verify product information and ownership history without relying on a central authority.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize global supply chain management by creating a transparent, secure, and efficient tracking system that:

- **Eliminates Counterfeiting**: Provides immutable proof of product authenticity and origin
- **Enhances Transparency**: Offers complete visibility into product journey from manufacturer to consumer
- **Builds Trust**: Creates a trustless system where all parties can verify information independently
- **Improves Efficiency**: Reduces paperwork and manual tracking through automated blockchain processes
- **Enables Accountability**: Maintains permanent records of all transactions and ownership transfers
- **Supports Sustainability**: Enables tracking of ethical sourcing and environmental impact
